# Thought Bank
A simple web app for noting your thoughts.

Currently not deployed anywhere. I have to fix the tests.

I should probably mention that I am a babby programmer. I'm just following the Meteor tutorial to build this app. I do hope that someday I'll be an advanced enough dev to do this app justice.

## What it does:

###### _(I'll have screenshots later)_

- Stores Thoughts in text form (more acurately, text-in-an-object form) and lists them (newest at the top)
- Thoughts are associated with your account which you ~~may~~ have to create
- Thoughts are private to your account
- Thoughts can be archived (not deleted, that'll come later)

### What else it does:

- ...You can change your password if you want

## What I want it to do soon:

- [ ] Be deployed somewhere
- [ ] Have its own styling that I didn't just copy because I'm following a tutorial
- [ ] Have tests that actually pass (I'm using Mocha btw)
- [ ] ~~Take over the planet with its advanced AI~~  Change the Thought in the database that shows up when you're not logged in (you'll know what I mean once I've deployed)

... Let me know if I missed anything that should be here
